And if I [Am]fall, I'll rise a[G]gain,  
For every [C]loss, a chance to [F]gain,  
With [Am]courage as my [G]guiding star,  
I'll [C]travel near, I'll travel [F]far.

So here's to [Am]paths that lie a[G]head,  
To every [C]word we've yet to [F]be said,  
With [Am]hope and love, and [G]dreams so wide,  
We'll [C]find our place, and there a[F]bide.`,

And if I fall, I'll rise again,  
For every loss, a chance to gain,  
With courage as my guiding star,  
I'll travel near, I'll travel far.

Oh, my journey, my tale to weave,  
Through the darkness, I believe,  
With every step, a new sunrise,  
In this world of endless skies.
So here's to paths that lie ahead,  
To every word we've yet to be said,  
With hope and love, and dreams so wide,  
We'll find our place, and there abide.
